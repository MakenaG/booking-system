# Ticket-Ally

This is a web application developed using React and a dummy database from Mocky. It allows administrators to manage events, including adding, editing, and removing events. For each event, administrators can specify ticket prices for VIP and regular tickets, as well as the maximum number of attendees. Users can view event details and reserve tickets, with the ability to reserve up to 5 tickets at a time. Upon successful reservation, users receive email notifications.
